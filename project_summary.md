## Description
This is an Android app that leverages the Accelerometer sensor that is built into modern SmartPhones. This sensor monitors acceleration along X, Y and Z axes. The App shows a plot of acceleration with time for the selected axis. 
It can be applied in different domains to perform vibration analysis. Lot depends on how you place the phone on the machine - as close as possible to the source of vibration.
