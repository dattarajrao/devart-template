Vibration Monitoring App for Android SmartPhones
In industrial machines, accelerometers are mounted appropriately on the machine to monitor axial and radial vibrations and using frequency analysis - frequencies of interest are identified which can show signatures of imbalance, misalignment or even cracks.
This is a general purpose app that uses the SmartPhone sensor. It can be applied in different domains to perform vibration analysis. Lot depends on how you place the phone on the machine - as close as possible to the source of vibration.
