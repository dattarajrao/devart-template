Vibration Monitoring App for Android SmartPhones
This is an Android app that leverages the Accelerometer sensor that is built into modern SmartPhones. This sensor monitors acceleration along X, Y and Z axes. The App shows a plot of acceleration with time for the selected axis. It allows to select the axis for consideration.
