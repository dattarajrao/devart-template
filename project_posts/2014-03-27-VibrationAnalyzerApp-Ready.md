Vibration Monitoring App for Android SmartPhones
This is an Android app that leverages the Accelerometer sensor that is built into modern SmartPhones. This sensor monitors acceleration along X, Y and Z axes. The App shows a plot of acceleration with time for the selected axis. It allows to select the axis for consideration.
This is a general purpose app that uses the SmartPhone sensor. It can be applied in different domains to perform vibration analysis. Lot depends on how you place the phone on the machine - as close as possible to the source of vibration.
There are buttons available that let you change the Axis to measure vibration on and change the frequency of data sampling to perform analysis. You can also Pause the app to study a particular chart and zoom and pan on the charts. The Save button lets you copy the chart into "png" images on your phone.

Would love to hear if you found this beneficial. Write to me at: dattarajrao@yahoo.com
