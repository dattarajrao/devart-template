Vibration Monitoring App for Android SmartPhones
A time domain plot of acceleration gives limited information. It can help detect motion in particular direction and measure amount of motion, velocity, etc. However when there is repeated motion or vibration we see a definite pattern in the time plot. More details can be obtained using Fourier Analysis using a technique called Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). DFT converts the signal from time to frequency domain providing the frequencies in which the energy of the signal is distributed.
